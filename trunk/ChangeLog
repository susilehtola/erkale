This file contains a brief development changelog. The full changelog is
available in the version control system on the project homepage.

2011-06-10 Jussi Lehtola
	* Closed shell calculations can now be initialized also with a
	divide-and-conquer calculation by specifying
	   Method DnC
	This should find all the molecules in the system, and initialize
	them with a gas-phase calculation.

2011-06-08 Jussi Lehtola
	* Fixed again unrestricted calculations.
	* Parallel and serial versions of the binaries and libraries can now
	be installed simultaneously.

2011-06-05 Jussi Lehtola
	* Switch to using CMake to make implementing different build options
	easier.
	* Unified user interface to a single binary (no more separate DFT and
	HF executables).
	* Added support for using a system-wide basis set library.

2011-06-02 Jussi Lehtola
	* Turn on screening in on-the-fly density fitting.
	* Fixed unpolarized Broyden accelerators.
	* Largeish printout changes.

2011-05-31 Jussi Lehtola
	* Reorganization of compilation units of DFT related functions.
	* Exchange-correlation is now specified in one line.
	* Added InitMethod option for initializing calculations.

2011-05-25 Jussi Lehtola
	* Introduced erkale_prof, which can be used to compute completeness
	profiles of basis sets.

2011-05-24 Jussi Lehtola
	* Broyden solution works after all.

2011-05-21 Jussi Lehtola
	* Published project on Google Code.

2011-05-14 Jussi Lehtola
	* Changed header filex to use doxygen format.

2011-05-11 Jussi Lehtola
	* Rewrote DFT code to use memory more continguously by not having
	separate objects for radial shells.
	* Implemented meta-GGA in principle (needs debugging).
	* Implemented Lebedev grids.

2011-05-09 Jussi Lehtola
	* Broyden mixing of density matrices leads in convergence to wrong result.
	* Broyden mixing of Fock matrices leads in convergence to wrong result.
	* Implemented ADIIS instead, which seems to work quite well.

2011-04-27 Jussi Lehtola
	* Implemented Broyden mixing.

2011-03-31 Jussi Lehtola
	* GGA works now.

2011-03-19 Jussi Lehtola
	* LDA DFT is now implemented.

2011-03-07 Jussi Lehtola
	* Implemented electron momentum density calculations.

2011-01-10 Jussi Lehtola
	* Implemented UHF.
	* Implemented Settings class.

2011-01-08 Jussi Lehtola
	* Basis sets with mixed use of cartesians and spherical harmonics
	work now.

2011-01-07 Jussi Lehtola
	* Transformation of integrals into spherical basis.

2011-01-05 Jussi Lehtola
	* Code supports Gaussian basis sets of arbitrary size.
	* 1-electron integrals are computed with Obara-Saika routines.
	* 2-electron integrals are computed with libint.
	* Only RHF currently implemented.
