	* Published project on Google Code.

2011-05-14 Jussi Lehtola
	* Changed header filex to use doxygen format.

2011-05-11 Jussi Lehtola
	* Rewrote DFT code to use memory more continguously by not having
	separate objects for radial shells.
	* Implemented meta-GGA in principle (needs debugging).
	* Implemented Lebedev grids.

	* Broyden mixing of density matrices leads in convergence to wrong result.
	* Broyden mixing of Fock matrices leads in convergence to wrong result.
	* Implemented ADIIS instead, which seems to work quite well.

2011-04-27 Jussi Lehtola
	* Implemented Broyden mixing.

2011-03-31 Jussi Lehtola
	* GGA works now.

2011-03-19 Jussi Lehtola
	* LDA DFT is now implemented.

2011-03-07 Jussi Lehtola
	* Implemented electron momentum density calculations.

2011-01-10 Jussi Lehtola
	* Implemented UHF.
	* Implemented Settings class.

2011-01-08 Jussi Lehtola
	* Basis sets with mixed use of cartesians and spherical harmonics
	work now.

2011-01-07 Jussi Lehtola
	* Transformation of integrals into spherical basis.

2011-01-05 Jussi Lehtola
	* Code supports Gaussian basis sets of arbitrary size.
	* 1-electron integrals are computed with Obara-Saika routines.
	* 2-electron integrals are computed with libint.
	* Only RHF currently implemented.
