* Rewrite the SCF solver in a clearer, more object-oriented form.

* Speed up direct computation of Coulomb and exchange by only computing differences.

* Debug meta-GGA & meta-GGA functionals (in collaboration with libxc upstream).

* Speed up ERI computation by precomputing shell pair data.

* Add failsafes to settings, e.g., thresholds must be positive.

* Implement ROHF.

* Implement possibility to use mixed basis sets (e.g. use a larger basis set for a single atom in a calculation)

* Implement checkpointing / saving of results.
