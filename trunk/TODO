* Update documentation
  - Compilation with cmake
  - Usage of unified executable

* Fix densityfitting memory estimate.

* Debug unrestricted calculations, which seem to have broken.

* Write pretty-printing routine for making bars such as *** text ***
  or --- text ---.

* Implement writing of cube files, for visualization of e.g. electron
  density and molecular orbitals.

* Rewrite the SCF solver in a clearer, more object-oriented form. (?)

* Debug meta-GGA & meta-GGA functionals (in collaboration with libxc
  upstream).

* Speed up ERI computation by precomputing shell pair data.

* Add failsafes to settings, e.g., thresholds must be positive.

* Implement ROHF.

* Implement possibility to use mixed basis sets (e.g. use a larger
  basis set for a single atom in a calculation)

* Implement checkpointing / saving of results.

* Implement calculation of electrostatic molecular potential.
