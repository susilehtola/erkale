* Implement checkpointing / saving of results (using HDF5?).

* The number of executables is growing rapidly => identify common code and place in parser routines.

* Installed headers need to be preprocessed.

* Write pretty-printing routine for making bars such as *** text ***
  or --- text ---.

* Implement writing of cube files, for visualization of e.g.
  - electron density
  - molecular orbitals.
  - electrostatic potential

* Find out why kinetic energy functionals don't work, in collaboration
  with libxc upstream.

? Implement GGA in Casida.

? Implement better starting guesses, e.g. Harris functional.

* Add failsafes to settings, e.g., thresholds must be positive.

? Rewrite the SCF solver in a clearer, more object-oriented form.

? Speed up ERI computation by precomputing shell pair data.
