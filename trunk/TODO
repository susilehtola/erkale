* Optimize AtomGrid::eval_Fxc.

* Installed headers need to be preprocessed.

* Write pretty-printing routine for making bars such as *** text ***
  or --- text ---.

* Implement writing of cube files, for visualization of e.g.
  - electron density
  - molecular orbitals.
  - electrostatic potential

* Debug meta-GGA & meta-GGA functionals (in collaboration with libxc
  upstream).

* Speed up ERI computation by precomputing shell pair data.

* Add failsafes to settings, e.g., thresholds must be positive.

* Implement ROHF.

* Implement checkpointing / saving of results.

? Rewrite the SCF solver in a clearer, more object-oriented form.
