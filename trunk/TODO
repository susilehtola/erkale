* Rewrite the SCF solver in a clearer, more object-oriented form. (?)

* Implement screening in the density fitting routines.

* Debug meta-GGA & meta-GGA functionals (in collaboration with libxc upstream).

* Speed up ERI computation by precomputing shell pair data.

* Add failsafes to settings, e.g., thresholds must be positive.

* Implement ROHF.

* Implement possibility to use mixed basis sets (e.g. use a larger basis set for a single atom in a calculation)

* Implement checkpointing / saving of results.

* Implement calculation of electrostatic molecular potential.
