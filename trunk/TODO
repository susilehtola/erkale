Some things that would be nice.

* Optimize DFT forces by rewriting them to use BLAS routines.

* Optimize HF/Coulomb matrix force calculation by using intermediate
  step in the contraction with the density matrix.

* Implement GGA in Casida [Bauernschmitt and Ahlrichs, CPL 256, 454 (1996)].

* Implement molecular dynamics.

* Implement propagation TDDFT.

* Implement computation of two-electron completeness profiles.
