** Prerequisites **

To compile ERKALE you need

* The GNU Scientific Library ( http://www.gnu.org/s/gsl/ )
* libint ( http://sourceforge.net/p/libint/home )
* libxc ( http://www.tddft.org/programs/octopus/wiki/index.php/Libxc )
* Armadillo ( http://arma.sourceforge.net/ )

Naturally, you also need a decent LAPACK library installed. The use of
an optimized library such as ATLAS, Intel MKL or AMD ACML is recommended.

When the prerequisites are installed, compiling ERKALE should be as
easy as running
 $ make

In addition, if you wish to create the developer documentation, you
need a working installation of doxygen and LaTeX. The documentation
can be created by running
 $ make doc

** Flavors of ERKALE **

The compilation creates two versions of ERKALE: a serial version and
an OpenMP parallellized version suitable for running on shared memory
computers. The parallellization is quite trivial, but should still
give about 80% of speedup.

In addition, there are currently two flavors of executables: the
Hartree-Fock executable 'hf.x' and the density-functional theory
executable 'dft.x'.


** Usage **

The usage of both is the following:
    $ hf.x/dft.x atoms.xyz basis.gbs (settings)
in which
   * atoms.xyz contains the system in xyz format
   * basis.gbs is the basis set to be used in Gaussian '94 format
   * settings is an optional Settings file; if one isn't given default
     values are used

Here is an example of an xyz file

     3
     B3LYP aug-cc-pVTZ optimized water molecule
     O	    0.000000    0.117030    0.000000
     H	    0.763404   -0.468123    0.000000
     H	   -0.763404   -0.468115    0.000000

A selection of commonly used basis sets is shipped alongside ERKALE.


** Settings **

ERKALE prints the settings used for the calculation, along with the
keywords, right at the beginning.

Some settings are only applicable to DFT, for instance DFT_X and DFT_C
that specify the exchange and correlation functionals to be
used. These can be given either directly as libxc functional numbers
(e.g. 7 for VWN correlation), or as case-independent strings
(lda_c_vwn for VWN correlation).

To use a hybrid functional such as B3LYP, specify
   DFT_X HYB_GGA_XC_B3LYP
   DFT_C None
since B3LYP already includes correlation.
