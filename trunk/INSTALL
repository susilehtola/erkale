** Prerequisites **

To compile ERKALE you need

* CMake ( http://cmake.org )
* The GNU Scientific Library ( http://www.gnu.org/s/gsl/ )
* libint ( http://sourceforge.net/p/libint/home )
* libxc ( http://www.tddft.org/programs/octopus/wiki/index.php/Libxc )
* Armadillo ( http://arma.sourceforge.net/ )

Naturally, you also need a decent LAPACK library installed. The use of
an optimized library such as ATLAS, Intel MKL or AMD ACML is recommended.

To compile, please use the attached script compile.sh and modify it to
suit your needs. Note that by default the build system creates an
OpenMP parallellized version of ERKALE. The parallellization is quite
trivial, but should still give about 80% of speedup. If you don't want
ERKALE to be parallellized, give the argument "-DUSE_OPENMP=OFF" to
cmake.

If you wish to create the developer documentation, you need a working
installation of doxygen and LaTeX. The documentation can be created by
running
 $ doxygen

** Usage **

ERKALE is used in the following manner
    $ erkale input

Here "input" is a file, that contains at least the directive "Method",
which can be either "HF" for a Hartree-Fock calculation or a
specification of a DFT exchange-correlation functional. For example
 Method gga_x_pbe-gga_c_pbe
will run a calculation with PBE exchange and PBE correlation, and
 Method hyb_gga_xc_b3lyp
will run a B3LYP calculation.

Please consult the libxc documentation for valid functional keywords.

Upon startup, ERKALE will print out the current settings, along with
valid keywords.

** Example **

Here is an example input file:
 Method HF
 InitMethod lda_x-lda_c_vwn
 Basis aug-cc-pVTZ
 System ethanol.xyz
 Direct  1
 UseADIIS 0
 UseDIIS 0
 UseBroyden 1

The first line specifies that a Hartree-Fock calculation is requested.

The second line requests that the calculation be initialized with a
S-VWN calculation. The idea behind this is to speed up the
calculation: by default a core guess is used, which completely ignores
electron-electron repulsion. By running a simple calculation with
rough accuracy the necessary number of costly Hartree-Fock iterations
can be brought down.

The third line specifies that the aug-cc-pVTZ basis is to be used in
the calculation. ERKALE searches for the basis set in the following order:
 1. A basis set library location specified by the environmental
 variable ERKALE_LIBRARY.
 2. In the current directory.
 3. In the system wide basis set library repository, which is by
 default /usr/share/erkale/basis. The value can be changed via a
 compile-time option (add to cmake flags), e.g.,
 -DERKALE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY=/usr/local/share/erkale/basis.
The .gbs extension is automatically added, if necessary.

The fourth line states that the atoms in the system are to be read
from the file "ethanol.xyz". The file must be in xyz format, for
example:
     3
     B3LYP aug-cc-pVTZ optimized water molecule
     O      0.000000    0.117030    0.000000
     H      0.763404   -0.468123    0.000000
     H     -0.763404   -0.468115    0.000000

The fourth line states that two-electron (and density-fitting)
integrals are to be computed on the fly. By default, the integrals are
tabled in memory.

The fifth line turns off ADIIS acceleration (incompatible with Broyden).

The sixth line turns off DIIS acceleration (incompatible with Broyden).

The seventh line turns on Broyden acceleration.
