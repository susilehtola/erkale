/*! \mainpage ERKALE - DFT from Hel
 *
 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * ERKALE is a code for Hartree-Fock and density-functional theory
 * calculations for atoms and molecules. It uses a Gaussian basis set
 * for representing the molecular orbitals and the electron density.
 *
 * ERKALE is written in C++ and uses the Armadillo template library
 * for linear algebra operations.
 *
 * ERKALE is designed to be as easily maintained and user friendly as
 * possible, but also to try to be reasonably fast.
 *
 *
 * \section why_another_code Why yet another code?
 *
 * I wanted to do some research on the modeling of inelastic x-ray
 * scattering. This would require low-level access to a quantum
 * chemical code.
 *
 * The code would need to have a gentle learning curve, be reasonably
 * fast for "production" use - and be free, so that I and others could
 * use the code anywhere they liked.
 *
 * As I did not find suitable existing programs on the market, I
 * decided to write my own program. This would mean spending more time
 * in development, although with the benefit of getting to grips with
 * low level stuff. The decision was made a lot simpler due to the
 * availability of fast, free libraries for computing electron
 * repulsion integrals (libint) and exchange-correlation functionals
 * (libxc), which meant that most of the dull stuff was already done
 * by others.
 *
 * Being free is also important because scientific results need to be
 * reproducible. The path from equations to results is often very long
 * in computational science; a working code used to implement the
 * equations is (at least!) as important as the equations or the
 * algorithms themselves. To guarantee that the code stays available,
 * I have chosen the GNU General public license, which is commonly
 * used in other scientific software as well.
