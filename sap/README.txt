Atomic radial potentials for 1 <= Z <= 102 at non-relativistic (nr)
and scalar-relativistic (sr) levels of theory for the LDA, PBE, and
BP86 functionals, generated from calculations with spin-restricted
i.e. spin-unpolarized (su) orbitals, spin-averaged potentials from
spin-unrestricted i.e. spin-polarized (sp) calculations, or potentials
from spin-averaged i.e. spin-mean (sm) densities of spin-unrestricted
calculations.

efficient orbital guess for self-consistent field calculations",
