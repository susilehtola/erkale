What is 
\shape smallcaps

\shape default
?
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape smallcaps
Erkale
\shape default
 is a code for Hartree-Fock and density-functional theory calculations for
 atoms and molecules.
 It uses a Gaussian basis set for representing the molecular orbitals.
 
\shape smallcaps
Erkale
\shape default
 is written in C++ and uses the Armadillo template library for linear algebra
 operations.
 
\shape smallcaps
Erkale
\shape default
 is designed to be as easily maintained and user friendly as possible, but
 also to try to be reasonably fast for calculations to take place in practice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The speciality of 
\shape smallcaps
Erkale
\shape default
 is the computation of x-ray properties, such as electron momentum densities
 and Compton profiles, x-ray absorption (XAS) and x-ray Raman scattering
 (XRS) spectra for core electron excitations through the transition potential
 approximation, and valence electron excitation spectra through the Casida
 method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape smallcaps
Erkale
\shape default
 is also the leading program used for completeness-optimization of basis
 sets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Why another code?
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:Why-another-code?"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wanted to do some research on the modeling of inelastic x-ray scattering.
 This would require low-level access to a quantum chemical code.
 The code would need to have a gentle learning curve, be reasonably fast
 for "production" use - and be free, so that I and others could use the
 code anywhere they liked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As I did not find suitable existing programs on the market, I decided to
 write my own program.
 This would mean spending more time in development, although with the benefit
 of getting to grips with low level stuff.
 The decision was made a lot simpler due to the availability of fast, free
 libraries for computing electron repulsion integrals (
\shape smallcaps
libint
\shape default

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "LIBINT"
literal "true"

\end_inset

) and exchange-correlation functionals (
\shape smallcaps
libxc
\shape default

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "LIBXC,Marques2012"
literal "true"

\end_inset

), which meant that most of the requisite, but rather time consuming work
 was already done by others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Being free is also important because scientific results need to be reproducible.
 The path from equations to results is often very long in computational
 science; the code used to implement the equations is (at least!) as important
 as the equations themselves.
 To guarantee that the code stays available, I have chosen the GNU General
 Public License (GPL), which is commonly used in other scientific software
 as well.

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\series bold
N.B.
 
\series default
The default is aimed 
\series bold
for LDA and GGA calculations on light atoms
\series default
.
 If you want to run heavier atoms and/or meta-GGAs, you should check that
 the grid is converged! Standard choices for bigger grids are (75,302) and
 (99,590).
 If the basis set is large like UGBS, you may need many more radial points.

For preliminiary calculations one may be interested in smaller grids, for
 which (30,170) might be okay.
